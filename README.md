### One-line Run-Script for NoMachine all component installer
NoMachine is a free alternative to TeamViewer or AnyDesk. And it is extremely performant. I've had excellent results, no lag, no sluggly experience, anything. 

With this script, I just need to download 'NoMachine' for my current PC, set the IP, Username, and Password of my remote machine, and that's it. A fancy linux desktop on the cloud. 

`curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntovarsolorzano/docker-installer-for-clouds/main/NoMachine-on-freshly-debian-ubuntu-machines.sh | sudo bash `

Enjoy.
